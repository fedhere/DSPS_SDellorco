I worked on this homework with Masooma Sarfraz and Miles Garcia. I also received some help from Willow in creating the Gaussian distribution to fit the Chi-Squared histogram. 

This homework is a practice in using multiple distributions. Homework 1, the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution, is a physics application of the Chi Distribution; it is a type of
Chi Distribution. Homework 2, the Central Limit Theorem, used Chi-Squared Distributions, Normal Distributions, Guassian Distribution, Binomial Distributions, Poisson 
Distribution, and the added Cauchy Distribution. The scatter plots were meant to exemplify the Central Limit Theorem, which states that as the sample size approaches the 
population size, the sample mean approaches the expected (population) mean.

The hardest part of this homework for me was the Fit a Gaussian part of the homework. I know there are many ways to do this, and I tried the way that you had mentioned at
first using the created Gaussian function. However, after struggling with that for a while and getting input from my peers, I found that the easiest way to do it (in my
opinion) was to just use a norm.pdf (probability density function) with inputs of the mean and standard deviation of the array of means from the corresponding previous parts.

I found that the easiest part of the assignment for me was the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution part. A lot of the questions were less coding questions and more conceptual
questions about statistics and what is being represented, which I have much more experience in than coding in Python.

The most beneficial part of this for me was to get more experience coding in Python. For example, one new thing I learned was about the linspace function, which is used to
create an even spread of numbers with an upper and lower bound and the number of values you want within that range. I have prior coding experience in other languages, but I
just started using Python about 2 months ago, and even then I have not had to use it much, so I am still learning a lot from my peers and the internet about Python syntax 
and common functions.
