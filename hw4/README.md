I worked on the first problem of the homework with help from Masooma, Paula, Rayta, Miles, Tali, and Zach. I worked on the second problem of the homework with Masooma.

This homework aims to reproduce the results from the link. The goal is to assess whether different treatment of uncertainties leads to different conclusions about the
presence of dark matter in a galaxy based on the rotational curves of the stars within. These two treatments are one in the graphs, and one from the vratios function.
Based on the graphs, the velocity stayed somewhat constant despite changes in the luminous radius, but based on the vratios, for N=1, 2, 3, the proposed proportionality
of $v\propto\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$ seemed to hold true. The results from the graph exemplifies the existence of dark matter, which makes up for the difference between
the proposed proportionality and the actual constant velocity. The other task created an MCMC sampler for a target distribution created from the Gaussian function and a
proposed distribution of a normal distribution. The loop for the MCMC sampler created many small samples of the large distribution to explore the large distribution, and
a histogram of those samples was graphed along with the proposed distribution. The resulting graph showed that the proposed distribution was a good fit for the samples of
the target distribution.

The hardest part of this homework for me was creating the vratios function. It just took a while to make sense of how each of the ratios was calculated, and then how to
structure that within the function. It did help me learn how to better format print statements, since I am still pretty new to using Python.

The easiest part of this homework was repeating the same process for the Milky Way data, as well as interpreting the results from the graph and from the vratios function.
After writing the code to create the graph and the vratios, I understood what each outcome would mean easily.

Some things I learned was, as I stated earlier, how to better format print statements, and also I feel I got a better understanding of a simple MCMC process. Actually doing
a problem using MCMC is different than just learning about it conceptually, and this assignment gave the opportunity for both.
