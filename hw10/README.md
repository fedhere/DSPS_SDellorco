I mostly worked on this homework alone, but I consulted with Paula, Miles and Masooma for help with understanding some of the figures, and I also consulted the video recording
discussing this homework on Canvas.

This homework has to do with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). We are given the Burger's Equation data for values t (time) and x (position), with the true values of u,
the fluid velocity, given as z. We then used PINN to create a model for predicting the values of u at any given t and x value. The challenge in Burger's equation is that it
involves non-linear differential equations, so in this we try to use a PINN that is fed the initial conditions and the boundary conditions to program the model to understand
the physics and to try to predict the solutions to Burger's Equation. Then we compare it with the true solutions.

The most difficult part of this homework for me was just getting a grasp of the topic, making sense of the given code, and making sense of the figures.

The easiest part of this homework for me was the coding aspect, as most of the code was provided and there was not a lot of code we had to fill in ourselves.

This homework gave me a better understanding of Neural Networks and strategies to understand visualizations I am presented with while having to figure out the exact context
myself.
