I worked on this mostly by myself, but I talked a bit with Masooma and Paula both during and after class.

This code is about using multiple methods to create a linear regression best fit line. Within this code we use the normal method, the sklearn method (which is a machine
learning tool in Python), and using L1 and L2 linear regression equation methods. At the end of my code I also included the Chi Squared Linear regression line, but this was
unnecessary for the homework assignment, so it was not included with the other lines in the graph in the comparison. Then, I repreated the L1 and L2 methods, but with
splitting the data into a test set and a training set. The dataset was split 25% (test)-75% (training), and a seed was used for reproducibility. R-squared values were found
for both sets of the data, and since the values were both close to 1, the linear regression line generated fit both the test and training sets well. This held true for both
the L1 and L2 lines while using the test and training sets.
