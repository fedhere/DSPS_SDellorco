# DSPS_SDellorco
Repository for DSPS 2023 Class (PHYS 461/661)
I am taking the class because I want to become more proficient in coding, and I have very little experience in Python. I just hope to get more of a background in Python. I do have coding experience in other languages like R, MATLAB, Java, and a few others, and I did start using Python a bit over the summer. I also think that I have a good work ethic and I am good at working in collaborative settings.
