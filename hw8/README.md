**The assignment is completed in the Python Notebook.**

I worked on this homework individually.

This homework was on what makes for a good visualization and likewise what makes for a bad visualization. In general, good visualizations are unambiguous, not distorted, and
not distracting. In addition, they follow the five rules laid out by Tufte, which are: The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graph itself,
should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented ("lie factor"); Clear, detailed and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and
ambiguity.  Write out explanations of the data on the graph itself.  Label important events in the data; Show data variation, not design variation; in time-series displays of
money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units; the number of information carrying (variable) dimensions depicted
should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data. Graphics must not quote data out of context. (As taken from the slides.) In this, I found one example from papers on
https://arxiv.org/ of a good visualization, and two of bad visualizations. I then used the second one and made an improved version of the visualization following Tufte's rules
and avoiding the three parameters that make for a bad visualization.

The most difficult part of this assignment was creating the improved visualization because I did not have the original data that was used to make the original visualization. I
had to improvise and make up my own data to get my point across. Since this homework focused on visualizations and not on the data itself, I think this is alright, since the
same visualization method and code could be applied if the original data was used.

The easiest part was describing what makes a good and bad visualization once I read and understood the parameters for good and bad visualizations. This is also what I learned
from this homework assignment. That is, I learned the parameters for good and bad visualizations.
